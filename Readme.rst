SimpleHtml5Editor
-------------------

SimpleHtml5Editor is just as it sounds, a simple html5 wisywig editor.
It comes as a jquery-and-compatible plugin, in fact, it's been built for 
zeptojs, but should work great on any jquery-compatible libraries.

This plugin is currently using bootstrap for styles, but will hopefully be 
removed or stripped in a near future, you can, in fact, just drop the styls 
from twitter bootstrap and make your own.

Configuration
-------------

In coffee/editor.coffee you've got the lines defining the current buttons, 
you can add/remove buttons or change its inner looks.

Side notes
-----------

This plugin is part of the group of plugins SimpleHtml5Stuffs, wich is part 
of GrassCMS project.

Note that I'm not supporting older browsers.
